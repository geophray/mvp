There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Meal Planning Made Easy

## Sub-Heading ##
  > The perfect meal planning aid for parents of picky eaters.

## Summary ##
  > Meal planning for people with changing tastes is no walk in the park. With Meal Planning Made Easy you can say goodbye to spending hours preparing a meal only to have your children (real ones or teens/adults that just act like them) turn their nose up at the dinner table. Easily keep track of meals each member of your family loves, food items they like/dislike/are allergic to, and when it's time to go shopping, just add the recipes to your calendar and have the ingredients conveniently added to your Wal-Mart pickup order with the click of a button.

## Problem ##
  > For many parents, just deciding what to make for dinner can seem like a gargantuan task. If your dinner table conversation is anything like ours, then you are no stranger to comments like "EWWWWWW!" or "This tastes yucky!" or "I hate peas!".  Add to the fact that maybe last week the same individual was heard saying "I LOVE peas!" and it is enough to make a grown mother or father cry.

## Solution ##
  > Our app aims to bring the frustration of planning and preparing meals for your family to an end.  By allowing you to easily track which meals each member of your family likes and dislikes, you can easily choose from a list of meals that everyone loves. (And when little Jimmy is away at scout camp, you can simply pack the week full of the meals he hates but you love!) Track each family member's tastes, or give them access and allow them to rate tonight's dinner and manage their own tastes so you never have to remember who liked what ever again!  Knowledge is power, and with great power, comes great respronstatrilitrance.  If someone in your family is in the doghouse and you need to send them a clear message, their least favorite meals can also be looked up just as easily! ;)

## Quote from You ##
  > I created this app to solve a problem in our own home that I assumed was also a source of great contention in many other homes. My wife is a stay-at-home mom who also runs her own business and homeschools our six children, and just deciding what to make for dinner was a huge stressor in her life. I made this app for her, but there are countless other hard working moms and dads that have benefitted from using Meal Planning Made Easy in their homes, and I couldn't be happier about it.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Just create an account and start adding meals. You can import recipes from the web or add your own family recipes simply and easily.  Add each member of your family and then you can start saving ratings based on each members preferences.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I don't know what I ever did without this app. It saves me hours every week in planning meals and shopping lists, and it gives our kids a constructive way to express their feelings about what we have for dinner. They are much more willing to try new foods now because they want to enter their rating on the fun little app.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Stop letting dinner-time decisions add stress to your life. Down load our app today and start tracking your families favorites, and see how it changes the mood at the dinner table.
